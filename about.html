        <p>
            Israel Silva is a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho.
            He is a senior studying Computer Information Technology.
            He started this project as a portfolio for a web development class, but it soon evolved into something much
            larger.
            Now, this is where he hosts all of his web development exercises in order to showcase his work to recruiters
            and potential employers.
