            <p><strong>Dinner Saver</strong> was an idea my wife had one day when she opened the fridge and said, "I have some nice ingredients in here, but have no idea what to do with them!"</p>
            <p>Knowing that I was studying web development at the time, she gave me the task to try and create an app that would take ingredients input by the user and suggest recipes that used those ingredients.</p>
