            <li>Things I learned or reviewed/practiced this week include:</li>
            <li>- It was very interesting to learn more about authentication.
                It was very difficult, I'm not gonna lie, but with a few more exercises and examples, I can learn it much better.</li>
            <li>- I also liked this team activity because it taught me how to follow instructions precisely and exactly.</li>
