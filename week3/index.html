            <li>Things I learned or reviewed/practiced this week include:</li>
            <li>- I loved the group project this week because it really pushed me to think. Learning to think is what I'm in college for, and I can say this exercise did just that. I got out of my comfort zone and thought in new ways</li>
            <li>- I used many array objects in order to solve code challenges</li>
            <li>- I practiced organizing my code in different lines (line break) to make it more readable to me</li>
            <li>- I started to make my home page more visually appealing by working on a new menu nav bar that expands in a more traditional way (over the content of the page instead of pushing everything down</li>
