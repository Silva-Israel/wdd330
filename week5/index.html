            <li>Things I learned or reviewed/practiced this week include:</li>
            <li>- With the Great Hikes team activity, I learned that you can manipulate the DOM
                 (Document Object Model) in amazing ways. Like the way we created a Hike class,
                  and then created new Hikes and displayed them with JavaScript</li>
            <li>- I also practiced debugging in the Chrome browser, which, coming from a C# in Visual Studio
                background, is very similar with breakpoints and all that.</li>
