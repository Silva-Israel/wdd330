            <li>Things I learned or reviewed/practiced this week include:</li>
            <li>- With the Tic Tac Toe team activity, I learned that something as scary as a tic tac toe game, can be
                accomplished in a simple way using JavaScript. We for example, used if statements for the logic, and
                touchend as the event since we are coding for mobile first.</li>
            <li>- With the explanations on Forms from Bro. Thayne, I learned more about local storage, input fields, and
                classes.</li>
            <li>- I struggled a little with a function not working in my JS because of other functions. I have not found
                the problem yet. Below is a code snippet of it:</li>
