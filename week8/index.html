            <li>Things I learned or reviewed/practiced this week include:</li>
            <li>- This week's reading covered, among other things, transitions.
                I liked how you can transition from one "page" to another by
                pushing one element out of the view with negative values,
                and then switching the one that was "hidden" and hiding the other one.</li>
            <li>- I also liked practicing using APIs some more. I created a whole page that
                used the Star Wars API and that taught me a lot. But then, at the end of the week,
                I found out that SWAPI was down, so I redid the exercise using
                the Pokemon API. Well, the POKEAPI is a little different from the SWAPI,
                so I had some new things to learn, for example how to paginate using the next
                and previous calls.
