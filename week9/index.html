            <li><a href="#" id="menu">Notes for Week 9 (Click to show)</a></li>
            <li>Things I learned or reviewed/practiced this week include:</li>
            <li>- Working with the BOM (Browser Object Model). I realized I already used it without knowing it had the name BOM.
                For example when I use window.alert("Hello").</li>
            <li>- I also liked learning more about how to learn which browser is being used
                (although that can be tricky as it can be modified by user).</li>
        </ul>
